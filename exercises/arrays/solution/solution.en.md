Now you know how to deal with arrays in Bash. They are handy for storing collections of data. For example, you may use arrays for saving the list of enabled plugins or commands which must be executed.

In previous exercises you have learned how to get your current directory using `pwd`. You may want to change current directory. You can do this using `cd` command such as:

    cd ~/Projects/my-awesome-project

If you try to execute this command you will change your current directory to `~/Projects/my-awesome-project` if this directory exists.

Run `man cd` to get know more about this useful command.

In the next exercise we will take a look at shell expansions.
