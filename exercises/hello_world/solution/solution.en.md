# You did it!

Gongratulations! You wrote your first bash script! Quite simple, isn't it?

By the way, pay your attention to `whoami` command. This command prints your username. That meand you can do something like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Hello, $(whoami)!"
```

This script will greet you personally.

In the next exercise we will take a look at variables.
